# Positive-FO

The purpose of this project is to implement an algorithm for checking whether a given sentence of positive first-order logic (PFO) follows from a set of atomic formulas. By PFO we mean the set of formulas of FO which contain as their logical operators only disjunctions, conjunctions and quantifiers.
